Frequencies: Although the Frequencies table may not have a direct need for the "location" column, it is possible that you might want to associate a location with each frequency, such as the location of a transit hub or the centroid of a frequency range.

Routes: The "location" column in the Routes table can be used to store the geographical location of the route itself. It could represent the starting point or central point of the route.

Shapes: The "location" column in the Shapes table represents the geographic coordinates of each shape point along the route. It is crucial for visualizing and rendering the actual shape of the transit route on a map.

Stops: The "location" column in the Stops table stores the latitude and longitude of each transit stop. It allows for precise geolocation of the stops, enabling the mapping and spatial analysis of the transit system.

Stop Times: The "location" column is not typically present in the Stop Times table because it primarily focuses on time-based information rather than spatial information. However, you can associate the stop location by joining the Stop Times table with the Stops table using the common "stop_id" column.

Trips: Similar to the Stop Times table, while the "location" column is not commonly included in the Trips table. The location information for trips is usually derived from the associated Shapes table, which contains the spatial representation of the trip's route.

Location col will enable spatial analysis, mapping, and viz of the transit. We can perform queries with precise proximity, distance calcs, and spatial relationships...
